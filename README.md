# Stock-Portfolio-Construction

A quantitative stock portfolio construction tool in python which selects stocks from a csv file of tickers and produces a portfolio of stocks with the optimal weight that maximizes the risk of the portfolio. This tool implements beta, correlation, "inverse" Sharpe Ratio, standard deviation and effective statistics analysis to evaluate the risks of each stock by utilizing frameworks/packages such as Yahoo Finance, NumPy, Pandas, and Matplotlib.
